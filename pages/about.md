RLG1000Y, used to be REL1000Y, Method and Theory in the Study of Religion, has been the core course of the doctoral program of the Department for the Study of Religion (DSR) since 1976 when it was first offered at the Centre for Religious Studies, the forerunner of the DSR. Although the purpose of the course has remained unchanged, which is to provide first-year doctoral students with a general understanding of the study of religion, over the last five decades, foundational themes and the pedagogy of the course have undergone transformation reflecting the overall development of the field in response to decolonization, the rise of Indigenous, Feminist and Queer studies and more. 

This growing collection of syllabi offers detailed information on course instructors' thinking and planning around required weekly readings and the ways of assessment. Each course syllabus is a time-capsuled epistemological imaging of instructorsâ€™ engagement with some of the theoretical and methodological debates and discussions during a specific phase of the development of the study of religion. 

The project is the first of its kind as it represents an earnest effort of scholarly introspection in the ever changing realm of study of religion.
